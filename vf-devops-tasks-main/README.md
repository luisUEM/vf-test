# Vodafone - Tasks of a DevOps Engineer

The tasks described in this case study try to evaluate different experience levels in 6 different areas and simulate the daily activities of a DevOps Engineer at Vodafone.
The aim is to give you an idea about what we do and to showcase some challenges that you may face.

## Knowledge Coverage
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Terraform
- Monitoring
- Troubleshooting
- Programming

## Environment Requirements
- Docker

```
You must have Docker installed on your laptop. It is the only requirement we ask, because all tools will be wrapped inside containers.
This is how we will review your solution.
```

## How to Start
We have split the tasks into 3 big sections `kubernetes`, `programming` and `terraform`
All of them have their own README&#46;md to guide you. There are no dependencies between each section, so it is up to you where to start.

## Submitting your solutions
Please submit your solutions in one of the following ways (PLEASE DO NOT COMMIT YOUR WORK BACK INTO OUR REPO!):
1. Clone the repository to your local computer, add your solutions, then create your own private repository and add the following user as a collaborator: junior.gonzalez@vodafone.com, then share the link with us.
2. Clone the repository to your local computer, add your solutions, then zip the directory with all content and host the zip file on an online platform live Google Drive, and share the link with us

## Notes
After receiving the tasks we ask you to send back a first version of your solutions within `1 day`. If you need, or want to spend more time on the tasks, just tell us that you intend to send an updated version later after the first day.

The tasks are a little broad and we don't expect you to fully complete them. So please add as many comments as you want to explain what you would do to solve the missing parts.

In case the tasks descriptions are not clear or if you are stuck somewhere, please contact us at any time! We value collaboration and asking questions.

Doing the sections listed in `Knowledge Coverage` partially is much better than doing 100% of a single section.
Remember, the goal is for you to show us your experience and problem solving skills!

See you in the next phase!
